WEBVTT

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.270
Followed your name into the

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.320
wild. Showed you my

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.600
shame, ran a mile.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.420
I sing your lullabies, melodies

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.540
like a symphony. We want the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.200
same inside a fight.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.900
I just need a little mercy, mercy on

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.730
me. Mercy on me. I could use a little
mercy,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.680
mercy on me. Mercy on me. I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.680
drank your holy water, liberty, your

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.580
make-believes. I could use a little

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.320
mercy, mercy on me. Mercy on me.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:09.080
I played the game, I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.160
reconciled. Well, well, well, well. I

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.580
wear the blame like a suit and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.540
tie. I sing your

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.540
lullabies, your melodies like a

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.900
symphony. We fall the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.780
same when we walk the wire.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.580
I just need a little mercy, mercy on me.
Mercy on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.640
me. I just need a little

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.600
mercy, mercy on me. Mercy on

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.200
me. I drank your holy water,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.860
liberty, your make-believes. I could

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.440
use a little mercy, mercy on

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.320
me. Oh.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.360
Yeah. Have a little

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.329
mercy on me. Oh,

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.900
yeah. I keep

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.640
growing and you keep tearing me down.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.440
Oh. I keep growing and you keep

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.500
tearing me down. I just need a little

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.680
mercy, mercy on me.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.750
Mercy on me. I just need a little mercy,
mercy on me.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.240
Mercy on me.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.700
I drank your holy water,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.460
liberty, your make-believes. I could

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.880
use a little mercy, mercy on

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:16.581
me.
